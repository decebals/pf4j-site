PF4J can be used in Kotlin project as well. One has to use the Kotlin annotation processing tool 
[**kapt**](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/kapt.html) for the plugin project written in Kotlin.

The `demo_gradle` project contains one plugin project _plugin3_ written in Kotlin for demonstration.

If you are interested in how to use PF4J with Gradle Kotlin DSL please take a look on [pf4j-kotlin-demo](https://github.com/twatzl/pf4j-kotlin-demo).  
Main points:
- all components are written in Kotlin: app, api, plugins
- using `gradle.kts` build scripts for the whole project
- basically an enhanced copy of `demo_gradle`
